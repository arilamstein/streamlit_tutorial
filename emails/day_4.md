**Subject:** Day 4: Deploy Your App and Share It 🌍

You’ve built a working Streamlit app. Now it’s time to share it with the world.

Streamlit makes deployment simple—you don’t need to set up a server or write any config files. Just connect your GitHub repo and go.

### 🚀 How to Deploy

Before you deploy, make sure your latest changes are committed and pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update app before deployment"
git push
```

Then:

1. Go to [streamlit.io/cloud](http://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in with GitHub
1. Click **New app**
1. Select your forked repo, the `main` branch, and the file `streamlit_app.py`
1. Click **Deploy**

Your app will build and launch in the browser. You’ll get a public URL you can share with friends, colleagues, or your future self.

### 🔁 Future Updates
Once your app is deployed, **any changes you push to GitHub will automatically update the live version**. No need to click “Deploy” again—just commit, push, and Streamlit takes care of the rest.

Tomorrow, we’ll wrap up the course and talk about next steps.

You’re almost there,
