Subject: Day 0: Why Build Data Apps with Streamlit?

Welcome to **Learn to Build Data Apps in Python with Streamlit**!

In this course, you’ll build and deploy a Streamlit app that lets users explore demographic data by US state. 

Users will select a state and a demographic variable, and the app will render a chart. A second tab will display the underlying data as a table table.

Here’s a sneak peek of the final app you’ll build:

The skills you learn in this course will be useful for any app you want to build in the future.
