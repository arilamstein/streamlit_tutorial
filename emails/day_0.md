Subject: Day 0: Why Build Data Apps With Streamlit?

Welcome to *Learn to Build Data Apps in Python With Streamlit*!

In this course, you’ll build and deploy a Streamlit app that lets users explore US State demographics. They’ll select a state and a demographic variable, and the app will render a chart. A second tab will display the underlying data in table form.

Here’s a sneak peek of the final app you’ll build:

The skills you learn in this course will be useful for any app you want to build in the future!

## What to Expect
