**Subject**: Day 6: A More Complex App—And You’re Ready for It 💪

You’ve built and deployed your first Streamlit app. That’s a huge milestone.

Today, I want to show you a more complex app I created: the **[Covid Demographics Explorer](https://census-explorer.streamlit.app/)**. It helps people understand how US counties changed since Covid-19. Here's a screenshot:

This was actually the first Streamlit app I ever built. And while it looks more advanced than the one you created, here’s the secret: most of the complexity is in the data and visualizations—not in the Streamlit code.

### 🧠 What You Already Know
The Covid Demographics Explorer uses Streamlit in much the same way as your app:
  * It loads data on startup
  * It has input widgets
  * Those widgets control what graphs are shown
  * The graphs are organized into tabs

Sound familiar? That’s because you’ve already done all of that.

### 🌱 What Comes Next
Now that you’ve mastered the basics, you’re ready to build apps that explore richer datasets, tell deeper stories, and help others interact with your work. Whether you’re analyzing civic data, visualizing trends, or just tinkering with ideas—Streamlit gives you the tools to share it.

### ✍️ Today's Exercises

Take a few minutes to reflect and write down:
 * An app you think you could create right now
 * An app you’d love to build, but think might be too complex to tackle just yet

This helps clarify your goals—and shows you how far you’ve already come.
  
Keep exploring,
