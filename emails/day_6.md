**Subject**: You Did It 🎉 What Comes Next

You’ve completed the Streamlit tutorial—and built and deployed your first app. That’s a huge accomplishment. Whether you followed every exercise or just dipped in and out, I hope you feel more confident using Streamlit to explore data and share your work.

This course was designed to be short, practical, and frictionless. But it’s also the beginning of something bigger.

### 🚀 What Comes Next

Now that you’re on my email list, you’ll occasionally hear from me about:
  * New tutorials and hands-on projects
  * Civic data tools and open-source releases
  * Workshops and learning opportunities

I try to keep things useful and respectful of your time. If you ever want to unsubscribe, there’s a link at the bottom of every email.

### 🙌 Help Others Discover It
If you found this tutorial helpful, consider:
  * ⭐ Starring the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/arilamstein/streamlit_tutorial)
  * 📣 Sharing it with a friend or colleague who might benefit

That helps others find it—and helps me keep making resources like this.

Thanks again for joining me on this journey.

Keep exploring, 

Ari Lamstein
